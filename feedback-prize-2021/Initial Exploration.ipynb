       "8006B9ECA272   The author states this in paragragh 8 saying \" To an expert, faces don't lie: these muscle clues are somtimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" polaticion or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" What this is saying is this new technology could help tell when someone is lying about cheating on a test or homework.

       "8006B9ECA272  How the author explains this is in paragragh 6. It states that \" A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" What this means is that how the students facial expressions react to what pops up on the computer can show when the student is interested in what is happening or confuse, and bored. And the author also stated \"Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive...   \n",

It states that &quot; A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored.&quot; What this means is that how the students facial expressions react to what pops up on the computer can show when the student is interested in what is happening or confuse, and bored. And the author also stated &quot;Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgerys&quot;. What this is saying is a computer can tell when you are bored or confused and help to keep you fouced and intertained more by making the lesson more expressive and also making it more interesting for the student.\n",
